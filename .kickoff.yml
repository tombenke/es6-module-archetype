    This is a project archetype for simple es6 modules
    New projects can be generated from this archetype by the
    [kickoff](https://github.com/tombenke/kickoff) utility.

welcome: >

    You are generating a JavaScript project, which is a simple es6 module.

postscript: >

    Next steps:

     - Install the npm modules required by the newly generated application:

        cd <dest-folder>
        npm install

     - Run the tests

        npm test

     - Create a GitHub repository and push the content of the project

     - Activate the repository on travis-ci, to run automatic tests

     - Activate the repository on coveralls.io, in order to get coverage value into the badge

     - Change the account names in links to coveralls and travis at the bottom of the README.md file
       in case they differ from the github account name of the author
